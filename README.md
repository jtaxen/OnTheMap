# OnTheMap

This is the fourth of the six course projects in the Udacity iOS Nanodegree program. The app lets the user choose a location by searching for the locations name, and then add a web link. A map is presented, on which this location is marked with a pin, and when touching the pin, a bubble appears, in which the users name and link are shown. By touching this bubble, the app opens the link in the device's default web browser.

The app also downloads other users locations and links from the Udacity server and shows these on the map.
